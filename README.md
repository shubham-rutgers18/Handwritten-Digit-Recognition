# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

### Technologies Used

MATLAB

### Dataset

MNIST Dataset for handwritten digit images

### Algorithms

The main algorithm used was k-Nearest Neighbours algorithm.  
Preprocessing was done on the input images like grayscaling, binarising, automated cropping of the ROI, resizing and binary inversion.
